# Ripples

Ripples is a survival game in which you try to earn as much points as possible before you lose.

The premise of the game is simple.
You start the game by tapping on the screen.
Whenever you tap the screen, two things happen simultaneously (from a human's point of view).
First, at the point you tapped, a ripple appears, growing in size as time moves on.
Second, at some random point on the screen, a red point appears.

If you happen to tap a red point, the red point turns green.

You lose the game when the edge of a ripple touches the center of a red point.
