# Ripples
In order to start the game, tap anywhere on the screen.

When you tap on the screen, two things will happen.
First, you will create a "ripple", a circle with a constantly increasing radius that has a center at exactly where you clicked.
Once the edge of the circle covers the whole screen, the circle starts back at radius = 1.
Second, a random point will appear any where on the screen.

When the edge of any circle reaches a point before you tap it, you lose.
A green point will mean that it has been tapped.
A red point will mean that it needs to be tapped.

This is a survival game, where you want to last for as long as possible.
